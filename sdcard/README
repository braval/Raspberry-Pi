This example sets up the mini uart at 115200 baud rate 8N1 configuration
Care to be taken that output is 3.3v and not 5v
Special care to be taken while using the GPIO's as they are directly connected to the ARM core
This implementation is based on polling and enables both receiving and sending
Minicom is fairly pretty easy to configure
NO flow control
save configuration and restart minicom for settings to take effect
The datasheet has errors, make sure you look at the errors on the give website

This example is my own implementation of FAT32 driver to do basic operations such as read, open, write and close a file.
For more details, please read the src/raspi/sdcard.c file 

Again, thanks to David for making it easy to understand.
